# Getting started

## Installation

AutoParser is a Python package that can either be built into your code or run as a
command-line interface (CLI). You can install AutoParser using pip:

```bash
  python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/globaldothealth/autoparser
```

Note that it is usually recommended to install into a virtual environment. We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the virtual environment. To create and active a virtual environment for AutoParser using `uv` run the following commands:

```bash
uv sync
. .venv/bin/activate
```

To view and use the CLI, you can type `autoparser` into the command line to view the options available.
